# Project Brief

The Happy Family Friends Charity are is a “food bank style” charity in the Nelson region who offer their educational skills to the local community.   We need a website for the Nelson region for members of the charity to provide lessons for anti vaxxers to rise up against government tyranny.

The purpose of the new website is to help with the distribution of the service or product by members of our charity to customers. Like a “food bank”, the website lets members register and describe the service or products they are providing, the number and frequency of the offerings. The website lets members of the community (beneficiaries) access the service, by providing tokens that can be “spent” in the service.

To achieve our goal, we would like to have an online token function on our website that let a beneficiary access a limited number of tokens, for example the system needs a mechanism that verifies that a member of the community is accessing the service and that the token belongs to a particular community member.

The website needs some homepage text about general information of our products and services such as: types, characteristics, quality factor, usage and benefit. We require the following features on the website:


1.Charity members and beneficiaries can register, log in and administer their own accounts.  
2.Members use the website to register their products and services, and beneficiaries use the system to acquire tokens.  
3.Interactive element(s) that engages the website user.  
4.The system provides an interface that the members can use to accept a token in a transaction.
