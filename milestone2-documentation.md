# Milestone 2 - Evaluation

## Report of web frameworks

Describes the purpose of web frameworks and identifies common framework features and
indicates those used in this website development scenario (15 marks)

- Has a formal definition of the purpose of web frameworks, describes common web framework features, describes those that are used in this website.

## Work Grid


#### Notes on test accounts

login with admin@no.com pass "no" for admin access  
login with prov@no.com pass "no" for provider access (though currently its no different than registering any new user)  
or create new account yourself  

Create a Work Grid to evaluate two web framework systems you propose for use on the project.  
Each framework is to be evaluated as described in the following. Include screenshots that demonstrate prototype solutions that meet website requirements. (40 marks)

How to evaluate your web frameworks.  
Identify two web framework systems. Install each web framework system. Find examples that will assist to implement each of the criteria in the Work Grid.
Demonstrate how the requirements would be met by each framework by reporting on work you undertook for each of the following  
1. Create a coded prototype “proof-of -concept” solutions (example code snippets) in each framework for the website requirements given in the marking grid. Include a screenshot of the solution. (5 marks each)

- Code example works, has a screenshot. code is commented with correct descriptions

2. Write a written statement that compares the web frameworks (5 marks) as follows.
Compare the complexity of the work you undertook to achieve a solution using
each framework, include code snippets. Also consider if the framework helps in the
development of your web site. (5 marks)

- Introduces both frameworks Includes an estimate of relative complexity ( APA7)

Marks for work grid:  
- Charity members and beneficiaries can register, log in and administer their own
accounts. i.e Members use the website to register their products and services, and
beneficiaries use the system to acquire tokens (30 marks)

- The system provides an interface that the members can use to accept a token in a
transaction , and store and retrieve data from a server-side database (API)

## Conclusion

Conclude the report with a recommendation of a web framework to use in the development of this website. That will be the framework you will use for developing your website. (15 marks)

- Identifies pros and cons of each framework. Justifies the selection of one over another in this context. Identifies the framework that will be used in the project (APA7)
