# Project Journals

I've chosen to use a software called jrnl to keep a record of my thoughts and learning process for this course.  
It's a lot easier than using the website i've kept for the previous years of work. Because of the effort involved in going to the site and then making a post about stuff everytime, it was never at the front of my mind and i'd always forget to do it.  
With jrnl, it's a command line interface that just lets my type out my thoughts easily and anywhere. I could even do it in the terminal in VSCode if i wanted to. Since I use linux, terminal is a daily tool and has a nice spot right on my dock. All i have to do is type `jrnl` and start writing, then press enter to save. It compiles all my entries with a timestamp into one file.  
I'll seperate the entries by dates and sort them into markdown files to paste in here for each milestone as required.
