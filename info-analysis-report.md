# Information Analysis Report

## Site Goals

Happy Family Friends is a charity group dedicated to bringing together vaccination-opposed people with the aim of providing free lessons and learning, short courses, and donated items. Our hope is that groups will come together and take our valuable knowledge and resources out into the field to fight against the fascist government's vaccinate and mask mandates, showing them who the free people of New Zealand are.
Our goals are to spread the word around in online groups for people to get signed up and involved with us, all the way up until we become a household name as the fount of boundless knowledge and training, benevolent benefactors of the free, whispered in secret shadows, instilling fear into any politician at the mere thought of what we can accomplish together. We hope to build a community together with the great work we will be doing, for providers of services, and regular members alike, and hope to attract people who share these ideals.


## Define the User Experience 

### Audience

Our audience will be anyone who has an interest in our ideals, who wants to get involved with their community and help out others, forming connections with other people and coming together for a common cause. We would bring in mentors who could teach our members, helpful people who could share their resources with the community, such as equipment, spare parts for workshops we offer, spaces to meet, places to host events we conduct. As well we people who want to learn about these things and participate, getting skills and knowledge under their belt.

Types of users we have are Providers and Members. Providers are the people who are running their services through us, and members are the ones who are using the services. There is also a third type, admin user which is only used for systems administration. The type of user you are is designated by yourself when registering on the website. Each type has different access levels of what they can do.


### User scenarios

> Venat is a kind hearted woman who has experienced much of life and has bounds of worldly knowledge. Many who have met her would consider her rather eccentric. She if of the opinion that most conspiracy theories have merit to them and makes it her mission to get to the bottom of the state of things when important events happen, disbeliving of what the commonfolk are told as truths, she prefers to look deeper. She would like our help to get in contact with members of the public who are interested or curious about vaccines and 'what they don't want us to know', as well as a myriad of other truths behind The Plague, so she can deliver weekly seminars on the subjects to educate people.

> A dour, unapologetic military veteran, Emet-Selch is a man of solid principals, who has been persuaded to offer his expertise by a close friend. He would instruct wanting students in his hands-on methods of tacking together homemade weapons and devices from scraps of common items one might easily have on hand or can find. The charity helps both him to form a sorely needed connection with his fellow man to soften his heart and uncover his deep down compassion for humanity, and his students who stand to learn from a master.

> Hythlodaeus, a friendly and perceptive young man, has gotten tired of government instructions when he sees that both vaccinated and unvaccinated alike are succumbing to The Plague. He wonders what the point of all this control even is if no mandates or prevention methods can alter the course of history as it is happening. He has been growing restless, and so inspired to seek out what he could do to play his part in everything and support what he believes, looking for ways to change things, he finds our website and signs up for a few services that catch his eye.


### Competitive Analysis

It was a struggle to find any other charities with the same concept as this, being goods and services distribution that actually happened via the website, so I have investigated some general charities and their websites.


### Feeding America

https://www.feedingamerica.org/

This charity tackles hunger in America. Their home page features a carousel of pictures with call to action buttons, a tool to find local food banks, facts about the cause they are fighting for, and more options to donate and get involved. On their nav bar which is in a fixed position so you can see it as you scroll, we have a few typical links, but also buttons for donate, and one if you need help yourself. So it's easily navigational with the main activities you would do on their website, hard to miss.

### Rotary Club International

https://www.rotary.org/en

This is a global charity that usually have a club in most cities. They are community members who get together, volunteering to create lasting changes. Their site is actually very large, with a dropdown menu opening up when you hover over their nav showing off basically their whole site map. The website comes together and features smooth animations of sections that zoom into place as you scroll down. They show off facts of their impact and what they;ve done and then their causes are organized in a little circluar image layout, clicking each one will take you to the section for more information in what youre interested in doing.

### Habitat for Humanity

This charity provides housing for those in need, as suggested by their name. The website showcases stories and news for what they have achieved and things happening related to what they're doing. Featuring social media links and a call to action on their nav, as well as the main section showing you where you can find your local branch, and sign up for their newsletter to never miss out on their activities.

### International Rhino Foundation

https://rhinos.org/

A charity who wants to save the endangered rhino population in africa, this is a very nice looking website featuring a good colour scheme that fits in with what they do. The layout is nice and smooth, with the content animating into view as you scroll down. Each section has not too much writing so as to not get the reader overwhelmed with info, but small blurbs and action buttons, as well as pictures of the animal theyre helping. The very first section of the site has a fullscreen Rhino on it with a little statement and a button for further information of their vision. Their main focus is to get donations to help with their work and it's easy to find those with bold buttons to donate, adopt, and shop.

### Humane society of the treasure coast

https://hstc1.org/

This group is a no-kill shelter for animals. There is a bit of controversy surrounding the most well known animal shelter, RSPCA, who put down their animals. HSTC don't do this. Their website features an automatic carousel of the main things theyre currently doing, then straight into an updated list of events they are putting on that you can get involved with. Followed by large call to action buttons of different things you can do to help. They have a nicely animated section showing their impact with numbers and facts of their efforts, and a link to a report where you can read more. Often featureing pictures of animals looking cute, their site successfully inspires you to give to their cause or help them out in other ways.

All these websites I found to have useful information on them, and their layout was easy to navigate with appropriate places to call to action buttons, which is the foundation of any chairity, for people to easily help out. What I thought was the best feature that a couple of these sites shared was a little field for their stats, showing the numbers of their impact. This really makes the users stop and think "wow this charity is really making a difference, I want to get involved too". Charities like the Rotary Club are more focused on local communities and what they can do to change things their. A lot of them in New Zealand do things like build playgrounds or public areas, and volunteer work as well as things like youth programs. This would be more similar to what my charity is doing. Something they all had in common was showing striking photos and imagery of what their group was focused on, so you can see they're out there in real life making a difference to real people and animals.

## Site Content

### Identify Content and Functional Requirements

My website's content will be a mission statement to straight away inform visitors of our goals. I'd like to copy some of the example websites and next put some like figures of our impact, or maybe something like showing a member count, which enforces the idea that the charity is a community people love getting involved with. Site should have a nav at the top with main links that may or may not stay fixed as you scroll, and a little logo picture with the name of the charity on it.

Following that with a section that shows people how they can help, with simple imagery and some examples of what they could do if they register with us as a provider of a service. My charity is slightly different in the fact that we won't require monetary donations, rather a donation of resources and people, as our charity is focused on skills and learning and having a community. In that section would be a link to register that takes you to the sign up page, where you can start browsing our current services or start your own. 

Next section would be featuring some example services of what a member will sign up to receive. This could be in the form of an animated carousel, meant to inspire people into joining us. This will have a register link as well.

There should then be a section with some image that takes a user to browse all our services which they can do without signing up.
Lastly a footer section with maybe some contact info or a newsletter signup box


## Site Structure

### Metaphor Exploration

#### Organizational metaphors

A comparison that defines the the aspects of the charity and what methods we operate by. These are like the values of the company and attitude that it has towards people. Most charities I would say are the same in this regard. The methods that charities use are people as a resource, either for their ability to donate, volunteer, get involved. We do not differ from the rest here.

#### Functional metaphors

Functional metaphors. Tasks that are similar that our users do. Our website is like a food bank out in the real world. But instead of being allocated an allowance of food, our members get an allowance for participating in activities, workshops, courses, and seminars. This almost functions like a polytech institute, but instead of professors we have members of the public who want to help out and build something together.

#### Visual metaphors

Relating visual elements of the site to other things. I have not worked on any visual elements of the website yet and have not had the time to give thought to what I could do, other than creating a logo. Given the basis of the website is to organize and skill up to fight and inform ourselves about an oppressive regime, I think pseudo military style graphics could be ideal. But we also don't want to give off an impression of violence. Could use recruitment drive style website as inspiration when the time comes to build the front end, and maybe things related disease, science, plagues, etc. It should be similar to other charity websites so when people arrive they recognize it as following stndard design patterns.
